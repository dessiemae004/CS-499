# Introduction

Hello, my name is Destiny Egan and thank you for tuning in to review my ePortfolio. As this ePortfolio was created to showcase my work, during my time here at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). Throughout the ePortfolio there will be shown evidence of my skills and abilities I have learned while completing the program. In this ePortfolio it is comprised of a professional self-assessment, the code review, and all three enhancements that were made to my artifact during the course. All three of the enhancements will shown my skills and abilities in the categories software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. With these categories the project ensures to cover all five of the course outcomes.

# Professional Self-Assessment

My journey in the computer science program here at SNHU began in the fall term (Oct-Dec) in 2022 and will be completed in the fall term (Oct-Dec) of 2024. Before my time here at SNHU I did have prior experience with computer science through highschool and my previous college. As I had taken classes working on programming in these classes. With my time here at SNHU I was able to enhance my understanding of computer science and gained very valueable skills along the way. As I learned multiple programming languages, mathematics, creating websites and applications, creating databases and so much more.

In this ePortfolio the focus will be on some of my skills and abilities that I have learned here at SNHU. As this ePortfolio is not a complete reflection of all of the skills and abilities that I learned here at SNHU. For this ePortfolio there are three enhancements that were made to a previous existing project, these enhancements focused on Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structure, and Databases. This artifact was a basic website that I created in my previous class IT-270. The website previously was only using HTML and CSS, to create the look and functionality of the website. As the website has hyperlinks to allow the user to navigate through pages. With this website, the Contact page did not previous take in the data that user could enter. This website was created for a pretend clothing brand company called Quality Closets, and throughout the website had five pages dedicated to the information needed for Quality Closets.

Software Design and Engineering was the first of the three categories that I made an enhancement for. As in the this category I had made changes so that Quality Closets website could be viewed with proper proportions on just about any site. When I was enhancing my code to make it so that almost all devices would view the site with proper proportions, I did run into come challenges along the way. As I had never had to make a website that also was proportionate to more than a desktop. At first when making my enhancement I tried changing all of my set values to percentages in hopes that this would help on both desktop and mobile device. However, I quickly realized that this would not work. I then began to research how this could be done so that this website could be mobile friendly. After researching I came across I video explaining the media tag and how to make proper changes within the media tag to make a website mobile friendly. Once I learned this I was then able to make the proper changes in the media tag on all five CSS files to properly show the site for devices under 600 pixels.

Algorithms and Data Structure was the second of the three categories that I made an enhancement for Quality Closet. For this category I had made changes by adding to my JavaScript file and creating and adding code to a php file. As this enhancement was to transfer the inputs from the HTML form on the Contact page to the database, while keeping the data secure. When making my enhancements to both files, I did run into some challenges as I didn't have much experience with JavaScript or PHP. For this project I began to research and watch tutorial videos on examples transfering data using both JavaScript and PHP, while providing security. From the examples I was then able to successfully prepare some of the code for the database that would be created in the next enhancement.

Databases was the final category that I made an enhancement for Quality Closet. For this category I had created a database for the inputs the user submits on Contact page to be saved. When making this enhancement made changes to multiple files as well as creating a MySQL database to the website. With this enhancement I needed to make proper changes to the JavaScript and PHP files, as they were not working properly. I ended up seeing a tutor that specialized in PHP, JavaScript and MySQL, with the help of my tutor I was able to see the typos and some of the general errors within my code. After the code was properly debugged it was then explained to me what had gone wrong within the code, which gave me a better understanding. I then created I file called admin.php where the data in the database can be seen.

# Course Outcomes

Course Outcome 1: Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science

-    This course outcome was completed in the Software Design and Engineering category. For this course outcome it was completed by making the website for a more diverse audience. Since the website was originally only created for desktop devices, but with the new enhancement it is now properly accessible on mobile devices.

Course Outcome 2: Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts

-    For this course outcome this was complteteed by the oral narration of the code review, that provided a overview of what my choosen artifact was and what I had planned for my enhancements. As I gave a oral indepth explanation on all three of the enhancements, while giving a visual on this by showning the code as well. All of the enhancements I had made were shown in the code review, showing that I was able to stick to my original plan and adapt the plan when needed. Just as I decided not to condense the CSS files, since they each had a purpose.

Course Outcome 3: Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices

-    This course outcome was completed in the Algorithms and Data Structure category. For this course outcome it was completed as I had designed and evaluated solutions for the problem that the data inputed by the user on the Contact page was not being interacted with and that the data was not being saved. From this problem I was then able to solve it being using the skills that I have learned through out the program. This showed my use of algorithmic principles, computer science practices, and standards appropriate to the solution.

Course Outcome 4: Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals

-    This course outcome was completed in all three categories, as each of the categories showed the ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills and tools for the solution of the problem. As thay all delivered value and accomplish the specific goal that was in mind.
-    For the Software Design and Engineering category this was done by using the skills learned throughout the program to the CSS file so that the website would be properly proportioned on both desktop and mobile devices.
-    For the Algorithms and Data Structure category this was done by using the skills and tools I had learned throughout the program to enhance the JavaScript file as well as add in the server.php file. As these enhancements were made to the project to help with transfering the inputs from the Contact form to the database.
-    For the Databases Category this was done by using the skills and tools learned throughout the program to create a MySQL database for the website. As the inputs fron the Contact form on the website was recieving data but did not save it anywhere. However, now with the enhancement I have solved this problem by successfully making a database for the information to be stored.

Course Outcome 5: Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources

-    This course outcome was completed in the Software Design and Engineering category. For this course outcome this was completed by ensuring security to the data while it is being transfered to the database. In the server.php file the code makes it so that the daya is inserted securely, ensuring that the proper database is being connected to. Also in the admin.php the database can be seen, but only when properly connecting to the server.
