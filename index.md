# Introduction

Hello, my name is Destiny Egan and thank you for tuning in to review my ePortfolio. As this ePortfolio was created to showcase my work, during my time here at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). Throughout the ePortfolio there will be shown evidence of my skills and abilities I have learned while completing the program. In this ePortfolio it is comprised of a professional self-assessment, the code review, and all three enhancements that were made to my artifact during the course. All three of the enhancements will show my skills and abilities in the categories software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. With these categories the project ensures covering all five of the course outcomes.

# Professional Self-Assessment

My journey in the computer science program here at SNHU began in the fall term (Oct-Dec) in 2022 and will be completed in the fall term (Oct-Dec) of 2024. Before my time here at SNHU I did have prior experience with computer science through high school and my previous college. As I had taken classes working on programming in these classes. With my time here at SNHU I was able to enhance my understanding of computer science and gained very valuable skills along the way. As I learned multiple programming languages, mathematics, creating websites and applications, creating databases and so much more.

In this ePortfolio the focus will be on some of my skills and abilities that I have learned here at SNHU. As this ePortfolio is not a complete reflection of all of the skills and abilities that I learned here at SNHU. For this ePortfolio there are three enhancements that were made to a previous existing project, these enhancements focused on Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structure, and Databases. This artifact was a basic website that I created in my previous class IT-270. The website previously was only using HTML and CSS, to create the look and functionality of the website. As the website has hyperlinks to allow the user to navigate through pages. With this website, the Contact page did not previous take in the data that user could enter. This website was created for a pretend clothing brand company called Quality Closets, and throughout the website it has five pages dedicated to the information needed for Quality Closets.

Software Design and Engineering was the first of the three categories that I made an enhancement for. As in this category I had made changes so that Quality Closets website could be viewed with proper proportions on just about any site. When I was enhancing my code to make it so that almost all devices would view the site with proper proportions, I did run into come challenges along the way. As I had never had to make a website that also was proportionate to more than a desktop. At first when making my enhancement I tried changing all of my set values to percentages in hopes that this would help with both desktop and mobile device. However, I quickly realized that this would not work. I then began to research how this could be done so that this website could be mobile friendly. After researching I came across I video explaining the media tag and how to make proper changes within the media tag to make a website mobile friendly. Once I learned this, I was then able to make the proper changes in the media tag on all five CSS files to properly show the site for devices under 600 pixels.

Algorithms and Data Structure was the second of the three categories that I made an enhancement for Quality Closet. For this category I had made changes by adding to my JavaScript file and creating and adding code to a PHP file. This enhancement was to transfer the input from the HTML form on the Contact page to the database, while keeping the data secure. When making my enhancements to both files, I did run into some challenges as I didn't have much experience with JavaScript or PHP. For this project I began to research and watch tutorial videos on examples transferring data using both JavaScript and PHP, while providing security. From the examples I was then able to successfully prepare some of the code for the database that would be created in the next enhancement.

Databases was the final category that I made an enhancement for Quality Closet. For this category I had created a database for the inputs the user submits on Contact page to be saved. When making this enhancement I made changes to multiple files as well as creating a MySQL database for the website. With this enhancement I needed to make proper changes to the JavaScript and PHP files, as they were not working properly. I ended up seeing a tutor that specialized in PHP, JavaScript and MySQL, with the help of my tutor I was able to see the typos and some of the general errors within my code. After the code was properly debugged it was then explained to me what had gone wrong within the code, which gave me a better understanding. I then created I file called admin.php where the data in the database can be seen.

# Course Outcomes

Course Outcome 1: Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science.

-    This course outcome was completed in the Software Design and Engineering category. For this course outcome it was completed by making the website for a more diverse audience. Since the website was originally only created for desktop devices, with the new enhancement it is now properly accessible on mobile devices.

Course Outcome 2: Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.

-    For this course outcome this was completed by the oral narration of the code review, which provided an overview of what my chosen artifact was and what I had planned for my enhancements. As I gave an oral in-depth explanation on all three of the enhancements, while giving a visual on this by showing the code as well. All of the enhancements I had made were shown in the code review, showing that I was able to stick to my original plan and adapt the plan when needed. Just as I decided not to condense the CSS files, since they each had a purpose.

Course Outcome 3: Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.

-    This course outcome was completed in the Algorithms and Data Structure category. For this course outcome it was completed as I had designed and evaluated solutions for the problem that the data inputted by the user on the Contact page was not being interacted with and that the data was not being saved. From this problem I was then able to solve it being using the skills that I have learned throughout the program. This showed my use of algorithmic principles, computer science practices, and standards appropriate to the solution.

Course Outcome 4: Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.

-    This course outcome was completed in all three categories, as each of the categories showed the ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills and tools for the solution of the problem. As they all delivered value and accomplished the specific goal that was in mind.
-    For the Software Design and Engineering category this was done by using the skills learned throughout the program to the CSS file so that the website would be properly proportioned on both desktop and mobile devices.
-    For the Algorithms and Data Structure category this was done by using the skills and tools I had learned throughout the program to enhance the JavaScript file as well as add in the server.php file. As these enhancements were made to the project to help with transferring the inputs from the Contact form to the database.
-    For the Databases Category this was done by using the skills and tools learned throughout the program to create a MySQL database for the website. As the inputs from the Contact form on the website was receiving data but did not save it anywhere. However, now with the enhancement, I have solved this problem by successfully making a database for the information to be stored.

Course Outcome 5: Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.

-    This course outcome was completed in the Software Design and Engineering category. For this course outcome this was completed by ensuring security to the data while it is being transferred to the database. In the server.php file the code makes it so that the data is inserted securely, ensuring that the proper database is being connected to. Also, in the admin.php the database can be seen, but only when properly connected to the server.

# Enhancement One - Software Design and Engineering

The artifact that I chose for Enhancement One was from IT-270 Web Site Design. I took this course here at SNHU in the Summer of 2024 (Jul-Aug), created the original artifact at that time.


Why I chose this artifact for this category:

I chose this artifact to use for my ePortfolio as this website I feel has a lot of room for improvement. Since it was a basic website created with minimal functionality, I felt that there were improvements that could be made to the site itself as well as other categories. For this artifact I decided to add some code so that if the website is on a mobile device the proportions are correct with the device it is on. By implementing this it shows my skills to solve problems and shows the skills I have with CSS. As this shows what all I can do with CSS, as I can build a website for desktop and mobile applications. Within the artifact before this change showed that I am able to build a website from scratch, since this started out as blank code when it was worked on in IT 270. By then enhancing it, this also shows that I am able to take already built code and make proper additions to the code.

Reflection:

Reflecting on the process of enhancing the artifact, I learned a lot through making this enhancement. As I previously had never done work in CSS to make the site proportionate to mobile devices. When working on this enhancement I did run into challenges and had to start over from my initial enhancements. Since I was trying to change all of the CSS file rather than adding code just for mobile devices. I learned this through research and tutorials. I was then able to take my learning and contribute them to my code, thus my plan to enhance the code was completed.


# Enhancement Two - Data Structures and Algorithms

The artifact that I chose for Enhancement One was from IT-270 Web Site Design. I took this course here at SNHU in the Summer of 2024 (Jul-Aug), created the original artifact at that time.

Why I chose this artifact for this category:

I selected this item to go towards my ePortfolio as I felt that this project had a lot of room for improvement since it was previously a basic website with minimal functionality. I chose this artifact for all three of my categories as I believe that all three categories could help towards the improvement of the site. For this artifact I added code that will help with transferring the data from the HTML form to the database, while keeping the data secure. When coding it showed my skills to not only solve problems, but also showing that I am able to adapt and code with JavaScript and PHP. Since this shows that I am able to code for both file types when coding for a website. Within the artifact before this change showed that I am able to build a website from scratch, since this started out as blank code when it was worked on in IT 270. By then enhancing it, this also shows that I am able to take already built code and make proper additions to the code.

Reflection:

Reflecting on the process of enhancing the artifact, I learned more in-depth about JavaScript and was able to learn about PHP files. Through the process of enhancing the website, I didn't know how to go about with the JavaScript code to make it so it would transfer the data to the database. With being puzzled, I then did research by watching tutorials to see what I could do. In all of the examples both JavaScript and a PHP file were used. I then took what I had learned and changed my code accordingly. However, after I added my database in the next enhancement, I then realized my code needed to be changed and went to a tutor to help. I was then able to ensure my code properly transferred over the data from the HTML page to the database, while making sure the data was safe.

# Enhancement Three - Databases

The artifact that I chose for Enhancement One was from IT-270 Web Site Design. I took this course here at SNHU in the Summer of 2024 (Jul-Aug), created the original artifact at that time.

Why I chose this artifact for this category:

I chose this item to be an artifact in my ePortfolio as it had a lot of room for improvement, as in the beginning it was just a basic HTML and CSS website, which had minimal functionality. This artifact was used for all three categories, as I believed that all three categories would help improve the site. With this category, the artifact I added in a database to the website. By adding it to the database, I then had to edit the previous code to accommodate the database added. As previously the code from last week had the basics for starting to transfer the data into the database. Now the code can successfully transfer the data into the database and be accessed through an external like for administration to see the data. These changes show my skills in multiple things as they showed my problem-solving skills, my adaptability since I was able to change the code according to the database. Before the artifact showed that I am able to build a website from scratch, since this started out as blank code when it was worked on in IT 270. By then enhancing it, this also shows that I am able to take already built code and make proper additions to the code.

Reflection:

Reflecting on the process of enhancing the artifact, I learned more on adding a database to a pre-existing website. Since I had made a database in the past, making the database was easy and I had no trouble when creating it. However, adding the database to the site and ensuring that data was properly being transfer was another story. So, when enhancing I did have to make proper changes to multiple files so that my code would properly transfer the code to my database while remaining secure. This was done by making changes to the Data Structures and Algorithms part of the project.
