# Introduction

Hello, my name is Destiny Egan and thank you for tuning in to review my ePortfolio. As this ePortfolio was created to showcase my work, during my time here at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). Throughout the ePortfolio there will be shown evidence of my skills and abilities I have learned while completing the program. In this ePortfolio it is comprised of a professional self-assessment, the code review, and all three enhancements that were made to my artifact during the course. All three of the enhancements will shown my skills and abilities in the categories software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. With these categories the project ensures to cover all five of the course outcomes.

# Professional Self-Assessment

My journey in the computer science program here at SNHU began in the fall term (Oct-Dec) in 2022 and will be completed in the fall term (Oct-Dec) of 2024. Before my time here at SNHU I did have prior experience with computer science through highschool and my previous college. As I had taken classes working on programming in these classes. With my time here at SNHU I was able to enhance my understanding of computer science and gained very valueable skills along the way. As I learned multiple programming languages, mathematics, creating websites and applications, creating databases and so much more.

In this ePortfolio the focus will be on some of my skills and abilities that I have learned here at SNHU. As this ePortfolio is not a complete reflection of all of the skills and abilities that I learned here at SNHU. For this ePortfolio there are three enhancements that were made to a previous existing project, these enhancements focused on Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structure, and Databases. This artifact was a basic website that I created in my previous class IT-270. The website previously was only using HTML and CSS, to create the look and functionality of the website. As the website has hyperlinks to allow the user to navigate through pages. With this website, the Contact page did not previous take in the data that user could enter. This website was created for a pretend clothing brand company called Quality Closets, and throughout the website had five pages dedicated to the information needed for Quality Closets.

Software Design and Engineering was the first of the three categories that I made an enhancement for. As in the this category I had made changes so that Quality Closets website could be viewed with proper proportions on just about any site. When I was enhancing my code to make it so that almost all devices would view the site with proper proportions, I did run into come challenges along the way. As I had never had to make a website that also was proportionate to more than a desktop. At first when making my enhancement I tried changing all of my set values to percentages in hopes that this would help on both desktop and mobile device. However, I quickly realized that this would not work. I then began to research how this could be done so that this website could be mobile friendly. After researching I came across I video explaining the media tag and how to make proper changes within the media tag to make a website mobile friendly. Once I learned this I was then able to make the proper changes in the media tag on all five CSS files to properly show the site for devices under 600 pixels.

Algorithms and Data Structure was the second of the three categories that I made an enhancement for Quality Closet. For this category I had made changes by adding to my JavaScript file and creating and adding code to a php file. As this enhancement was to transfer the inputs from the HTML form on the Contact page to the database, while keeping the data secure. When making my enhancements to both files, I did run into some challenges as I didn't have much experience with JavaScript or PHP. For this project I began to research and watch tutorial videos on examples transfering data using both JavaScript and PHP, while providing security. From the examples I was then able to successfully prepare some of the code for the database that would be created in the next enhancement.

Databases was the final category that I made an enhancement for Quality Closet.
