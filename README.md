# CS-499

This is my github.io website, which contains my capstone project for CS-499 ePortfolio. This
The assignment for this course was to take between one to three final project(s) from a previous class(es) and enhance it in three areas: software design, data structures and algorithms, and databases.

For this project I chose to use a project from my previous course and enhance it in all three areas, as well as making sure to cover all five of the course outcomes. Here you can see my Professional Self-Assessment as well as an in-depth look to each enhancement and the course outcomes.
